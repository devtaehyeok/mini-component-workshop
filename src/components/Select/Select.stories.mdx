# The sweet spot.

1. The native `<select>` element has some limitation in customizing (ex) icon isn't customizable and varies by platform)
2. Build it entirely from scratch, a daunting challenge when considering mobile devices and accessibility
3. For inputs like `<select> and <input type="file">`ÃŸ, a third option exists: we can keep the native input, but set it to be invisible

- We can create whatever presentation we want, and when the user clicks the form control, the real input will become activated, preserving the great cross-platform, accessible UX that these elements bring.

# The adjacent sibling combinator

1. Adjacent sibling combinator(`+`) apply styles to very next sibiling element after the element selected by selector group before `+`.
2. General sibling combinator `(~)` apply styles to every sibiling element after the element selected by selector group before `~`.
